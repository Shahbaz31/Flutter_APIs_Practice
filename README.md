# Flutter REST API Practice

This Flutter project is designed for practicing and learning REST API interactions, including POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE methods. The project uses fake APIs for practice and learning purposes. It showcases how to handle various HTTP methods in Flutter and how to structure API-related files.

- **GET Requests**: Retrieve data from a server.
- **PUT Requests**: Update existing data on the server.
- **DELETE Requests**: Remove data from the server.
- **HTTPS Methods**: Understand and implement different HTTP methods.
- **Fake APIs**: Use fake APIs for safe and controlled practice.
- **Organized Code**: The `lib` folder contains files for different API interactions and their configurations.
